# Deep Dive into Number Theory
- Developed a library to perform various operations requested by the user on a given input number, like calculating its square root,
listing out its prime factors, finding its divisors, calculating GCD(Greatest Common Divisor) and LCM(Least Common Multiple)
with another given number, listing out all the prime numbers till that number, and checking if it is a prime or a palindrome
- Implemented algorithms like Sieve of Eratosthenes, Binary Search, Euclidâ€™s GCD Algorithm for the above library, in C++
