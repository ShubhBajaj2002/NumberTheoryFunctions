# NumberTheoryFunctions
- Developed a library to perform various operations requested by the user on a given input number, like calculating its square root, listing out its prime factors, finding its divisors, calculating GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) and LCM (Least Common Multiple) with another given number, listing out all the prime numbers till that number, checking whether it is a prime and checking whether it is a palindrome.
- Implemented algorithms like Sieve of Eratosthenes, Binary Search, Euclid's Division Algorithm for the above library, using C++ programming language.
